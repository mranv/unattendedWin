# unattendedWin

Welcome to the breathtakingly underwhelming world of `unattendedWin`, where the magic of automated Windows installations reaches a new peak of mediocrity. 

## About

Imagine a world where you don't have to click 'Next' a thousand times to install Windows. Now, lower your expectations and you get `unattendedWin`. No description, no website, no topics—just pure, unadulterated XML bliss.

## Features

- **Zero Stars:** Yes, you read that right. Not a single star. We believe in being different.
- **One Watcher:** Probably just to see if we ever add a real description. Spoiler: We won’t.
- **No Forks:** Because forking this repository would mean admitting you need it.
- **No Releases:** If you think we're organized enough to make releases, think again.
- **No Packages:** Because why would you want to use this more easily?

## Contributors

- **@mranv:** Anubhav Gain, the mind behind this masterpiece of minimalism.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo, if you dare.
2. Stare at the `autounattend.xml` file in awe.
3. Use it to automate your Windows installation, probably while questioning your life choices.

## Contributing

If you feel the urge to contribute, we recommend a hobby instead. But if you must, fork away, create a PR, and pray we notice.
